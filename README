    - Logic
    - Stop and start streaming | not FFmpeg udp streaming
    - Image effects + params
	
Installation:

You need to install FFmpeg for RPi, if you want to use UDP stream and convert .h264 to .mp4. I will find a solution for streaming without FFmpeg soon.

- sudo pip install flask
- sudo pip install picamera
- git clone https://github.com/IljaGrebel/python-RPi-camera-controll
- cd python-RPi-camera-controll

Using:
- python __main__.py to start the script

You need some HTTP Requester to send request to RPi
# Start Record
http://rpi-ip:8080/start_record

# Stop record
http://rpi-ip:8080/stop_record

# Start stream
http://rpi-ip:8080/start_stream

# Stop stream
http://rpi-ip:8080/stop_stream

# Make screenshots
http://rpi-ip:8080/screenshot

This project is at developming at moment, but function described from above working.
